# Stable Diffusion data for AMD GPUs
An attempt to retrieve and organize all information regarding the use of AMD hardware for stable diffusion.

## OS
### [Linux](https://github.com/DaniAndTheWeb/sd-data-amd-gpu/blob/main/HSA_GFX_VERSION.MD)
### Windows: still not usable

## Why?
There's very little to no data around the web about the compatibility of AMD GPUs with stable diffusion and the information that I've found is scattered all over the web.
I've recently started contributing to the amazing [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) repo to help automatizing the setup and usage process of red team's GPUs and I hope that this repo could provide useful information for all the contributors of the project.

## How?
Every new information about a specific AMD GPU and its settings to use it on stable diffusion can be submitted as an issue or a pull request (contribution rules will be added in the future).

## Credits
Most of the information about the GPUs is taken from TechPowerUp's [website](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/).
